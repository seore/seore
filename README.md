# Hey there! 👋  

I’m **Seore** — a developer, artist, and photographer based in **London**.  

I love building things—web apps, games, little tools, and whatever random idea pops into my head.  
If I can imagine it, I’ll probably try to make it 😄  

I’m currently focused on **web development**, **machine learning**, **Pygame development**, and **Unity game development**.  


## 🔧 My Main Tech Stack

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript  
- Python / Pygane
- Java / Spring Boot  
- Unity (C#)  
- Bootstrap
- Flutter
- Three.js  

…and I’m always learning new tools, frameworks, and technologies.


## 🚀 Highlight Projects

Here are a few of my favorites:

- **Expense Tracker Web App**
- **Payment System Web App**
- **My Portfolio Website**
- **Phantom Trails – 3D adventure game**

Most of my projects start because I get curious about something—and then somehow it turns into a full thing 😂
